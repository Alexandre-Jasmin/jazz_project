Got it üëç I see the comments you left in your code ‚Äî let me walk through them and suggest how to implement those missing parts properly.

### 1. **"utilities should handle downloading and extracting code"**

Right now, your `DataDragonUpdater` does all the downloading and extracting. Since you already import `BasicUtilities`, you could move this logic there. For example, `BasicUtilities` could expose methods like:

```python
class BasicUtilities:

    @staticmethod
    def download_file(url: str, dest_path: Path):
        import requests
        response = requests.get(url, stream=True)
        response.raise_for_status()
        with open(dest_path, "wb") as f:
            for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
                f.write(chunk)

    @staticmethod
    def extract_tar_gz(archive_path: Path, dest_path: Path):
        import tarfile
        with tarfile.open(archive_path, "r:gz") as tar:
            tar.extractall(path=dest_path)

    @staticmethod
    def extract_zip(archive_path: Path, dest_path: Path):
        import zipfile
        with zipfile.ZipFile(archive_path, "r") as zip_ref:
            zip_ref.extractall(dest_path)
```

Then inside your updater you‚Äôd just call:

```python
BasicUtilities.download_file(url, archive_path)
BasicUtilities.extract_tar_gz(archive_path, NEW_DDRAGON_DIR)
```

Cleaner, and keeps responsibilities separated ‚úÖ

### 2. **"we also need to get the latest ranked emblems"**

Riot provides this here:
üëâ `https://static.developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol/ranked-emblems-latest.zip`

You‚Äôd want to grab that ZIP every update and extract it somewhere. Since the ddragon assets are patch-specific, but the ranked emblems are just ‚Äúlatest,‚Äù you could do something like:

```python
RANKED_EMBLEMS_URL = "https://static.developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol/ranked-emblems-latest.zip"

def update_ranked_emblems(self, patch_dir: Path):
    archive_path = DATA_DIR / "ranked_emblems.zip"
    print(f"Downloading ranked emblems from {RANKED_EMBLEMS_URL} ...")
    BasicUtilities.download_file(RANKED_EMBLEMS_URL, archive_path)

    print("Extracting ranked emblems ...")
    emblem_dir = patch_dir / "ranked_emblems"
    emblem_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    BasicUtilities.extract_zip(archive_path, emblem_dir)

    archive_path.unlink()
    print(f"Ranked emblems extracted to {emblem_dir}")
```

And call it from inside `update_league_assets()`:

```python
self.update_ranked_emblems(NEW_DDRAGON_DIR)
```

### 3. **"extract inside current_patch"**

Good note. Right now, you‚Äôre just extracting everything from the `.tgz` directly into the new patch folder. That‚Äôs fine, but some ddragon archives include a root directory. You might want to verify if extraction lands files at:

```
.../ddragon/{version}/dragontail-<version>/...
```

If so, you probably want to strip that root directory so everything lands **directly** inside `.../ddragon/{version}`. That can be handled by iterating over `tar.getmembers()` and trimming their `name`.

---

üëâ Do you want me to refactor your `update_league_assets()` now so it uses `BasicUtilities` and also downloads + extracts the ranked emblems inside the new patch folder?
